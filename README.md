# Polla

Simple voting app that I made to practise React and basics of Firebase. 

## How to use

Get all files and run npm install, then run app locally.

## Live demo

Live demo is available at https://mmuii.github.io/Polla

###### Known issues with live demo

Github pages doesn't work well with React Router so you can't navigate again to poll that you have once created because it throws error 404.
